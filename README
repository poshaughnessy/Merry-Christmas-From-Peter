To the creator of the robot model from the 'WebGL Up & Running' example - I would have bought it from TurboSquid
but it's no longer up at the URL referenced in the book (turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/475463). 
If you're the creator, please get in touch with me and I'll happily pay to use it!
