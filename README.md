# Merry Christmas from me!

Every year since 2010 I have made a web app as a kind of digital Christmas 'card' for my colleagues.
The first couple were basically CSS3 card effects with some flashy stuff added. The next two were WebGL, using Three.js
and Goo. Then 2014's was a mobile-friendly Pixi.js game called "Santa Wants Pies" and 2015 was all about Star Wars!

* 2010 - a simple CSS3 card effect - [demo](https://peter.christmas/2010/), [source](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/christmascard2010)
* 2011 - improved CSS3 card - [demo](https://peter.christmas/2011/), [source](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/christmascard2011)
